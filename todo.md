# Things that I am looking to do with this

## Animate Camera
Make a system in which the camera doesn't just snap to the new location and look at the same spot.
It should smoothly rotate and slide along to its new location.

## "Voxel" world
The world should be built by some amount of layers of "voxels" that create the landscape.
I aim to have 1 layer of ground with slopes, walls, and tunnels that can be used first.

After that the goal is to have multiple layers and other types of topography.

### World Size
This should be a 3d grid of the voxels that can fit within the desired world.
This should also be editable in real time for development purposes.

### Scene Loading
Create a way to make and load scenes via ron files or similar.
This means that I can make worlds in blender and tag each location with the type of data that should be passed into bevy.


## Characters and controlling them
Want a way to control the main character as well as the smaller units and towers that will come later.

This could be through the mouse or otherwise.

## Interacting with the world
Clicking on things would be good, as well as the ability to inspect or select items in the world such as
locations for building, units, or otherwise.

### X-ray
Give a way to see through both walls and ceilings/floors.

## Goals

# Inspirations
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuH19h0UKIo) is a video that gave me the ideas for a 3d iso game.
